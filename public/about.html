<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a final year student of physics at Universiti Malaya, and I'm incredibly passionate about software engineering. 
  Even though I'm majoring in physics, I can't resist diving into the world of coding and development. It's like solving 
  puzzles and creating something new every time I write a piece of code.</p>

<p>Currently, I'm still in the process of learning and honing my software engineering skills. I spend a lot of time exploring various programming languages, 
  frameworks, and tools to become a proficient full stack developer. I want to be able to work on both the front-end and back-end of applications, and I'm excited about the possibilities that lie ahead.
  Physics has taught me to think analytically and approach problems in a systematic way, and I believe these skills will serve me well in my software engineering journey too. 
  I enjoy building applications and seeing how they can impact people's lives positively.</p>

<p>My dream is to have a fulfilling career in the tech industry, where I can combine my passion for software engineering with my problem-solving skills from physics. I can't wait to see what the future holds, 
  and I'm determined to make my mark as a skilled and creative full stack developer. The road might be challenging, but I'm ready to embrace it with enthusiasm and dedication. Here's to a bright and exciting future in software engineering!</p>
